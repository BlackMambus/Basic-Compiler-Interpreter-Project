🧠 Basic Compiler & Interpreter Description

A basic compiler and interpreter are fundamental components in programming language processing. They help translate human-readable code into machine-executable instructions, each with a different approach to doing so.

🔍 What They Are
Compiler: A compiler scans the entire source code, translates it into machine code (or intermediate code), and produces an executable program. Once compiled, the program can run independently from the source code.

Interpreter: An interpreter reads the source code line-by-line and executes it directly. It doesn’t produce a separate executable file, meaning the original code is needed every time the program runs.
